#There are different types of loop statement in shell
#1. while loop: condition is true

#2. for loop: iterating over list / range / condition holds
echo "For loop........"

#3. until loop: condition is false
echo "Until loop......"

#4. Select loop: Used for menus / user choices â€” automatically numbers 
#options and reads input.

#Nesting Loops
#All the loops support nesting concept which means you can put one loop inside
#another similar one or different loops. This nesting can go up to unlimited 
#number of times based on your requirement.
